              | The company approached Six to produce a suite of branding materials for its new sub-brand, CF by Christian Fischbacher. A contemporary identity was required for the CF line to attract a younger, yet still discerning, audience and reflect the deviation from Christian Fischbacher's traditional range. Six also produced print and packaging designs, illustrations, and swing tickets and tags.
